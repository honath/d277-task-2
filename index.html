                    North Carolina was one of the original 13 states to ratify the constitution, placing
                    12th to sign out of the original 13.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The constitution was ratified by North Carolina on November 21, 1789.

                North Carolina is a Southern state on the East coast of the United
                States of America, often referred to as the "Tar Heel" state, and is
                home to a wide variety of mountain ranges and cities, some of
                which you can read about further on other pages of this website!
            </p>
            <p>
                North Carolina's geography isn't limited to mountains, and boasts several distinct
                regions across the 560 miles-wide state.
            </p>
            <p>
                Starting in the East on the Atlantic coast is the Coastal Plain, a relatively flatter
                and lower altitude region. A subregion of note in the Coastal Plain is the Outer Banks,
                which is a string of barrier islands. These islands have three major capes; Cape Hatteras,
                Cape Fear, and Cape Lookout. Various inlets and and sounds separate the Outer Banks islands
                from the mainland.
            </p>
            <p>
                Moving further West we find the Piedmont in the middle region of the state. The Piedmont has
                a higher average elevation than the Coastal Plain, primarily consisting of various foothills
                and plateaus, as well as hosting two of the cities shown elsewhere on this site.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, on the Western-most region of the state lies the Mountain region. This area is home
                to the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Great Smoky Mountains, which are a subset of the greater
                Appalachian Mountain range. Among the various mountains exists Mount Mitchell, which boasts
                the tallest altitude for any mountain East of the Mississippi river.
